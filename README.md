### ## Dataset for Predicting watering the plants
The main purpose of our system is to provide an automatic water supply. The product experience includes the gardeners are satisfied by automatic water supply to their plants. Product functions include provide water according to time requirement and sensors, activate relay motor automatically. Product features are real-time sensing and control, self controllable, complete elimination of men power. Customer revalidation includes farmers and gardeners who can automatically supply the water based on the soil moisture value.
